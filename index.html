          Billy the Kid is arguably the most famous outlaw in the history of the
          Old west. Shot by Pat Garrett when he was only 21, Billy the Kid’s
          reputation and legend only grew larger after his death.

          The one known image of William Bonney is a tintype that portrays him
          in mismatched cowboy duds, posing with a Winchester Model 1873 Rifle
          and a single-action Colt. Billy the Kid’s family moved to Silver City,
          New Mexico when Billy was fourteen. A possible prank gone badly at a
          Chinese Laundry where he worked sent Billy to jail from which he
          escaped, beginning a trend that would establish him as a wanted man.
          Supposedly, the Kid killed his first victim in the Camp Grant area of
          Arizona during a gunfight when he was around seventeen. Billy told his
          jailers that his opponent, who was much larger, was pummeling him, so
          he had to shoot the man in self-defense. He picked up the name Kid
          Antrim on his way out of town, which later evolved into the infamous
          title “Billy the Kid.”
